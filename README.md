# Project Overview
The Object-Detecting Vehicle is an autonomous system designed to detect and locate a specific object within its surroundings. It uses computer vision and machine learning to identify the target object and then autonomously navigate to find it. This project can have applications in various fields such as search and rescue, surveillance, and object retrieval tasks.

### Goals
1. Functioning AI Object Detection Model.
2. 4-wheel vehicle with Raspberry Pi.
3. Add a camera to said vehicle.
4. Make the Vehicle track and follow the object.

### Current Stage
The project is at its utmost beginning so this GitHub page is in its bare-bones stage right now. You can fork this repository for all your own needs and also can change the model for an object of your liking.
